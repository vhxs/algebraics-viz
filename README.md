# Visualizing the Algebraic Numbers

An algebraic number is any complex number that is a root of some polynomial with integer coefficients. The algebraic numbers
are a subset (and more specifically, a subfield) of the complex numbers.

Mathematicians have explored several ways of visualizing the algebraic numbers, including the visualization on Wikipedia. This code
is a Python rewrite of original C code that generated the Wikipedia visualization. It has a simple GUI that lets the user change
some parameters of the visualization, including changing the color palette or the radius of drawn circles.
